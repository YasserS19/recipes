    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A chocolate brownie or simply a brownie is a square or rectangular chocolate baked confection. Brownies come in a
        variety of forms and may be either fudgy or cakey, depending on their density. Brownies often, but not always,
        have a glossy "skin" on their upper crust.</p>
